## What is this?

This is a (fake) wellness site called “Zen”, for obvious reasons. With natural decorations and beautiful illustrations, this website shows all the cool features of a product. Has a landing page, about page, multiple feature pages, pricing page, testimonials page, footer, and so much more! 

It's a great template you can use for your own landing pages! (just credit me pls :)
